  * New upstream release.
    + Cleans up thumbnail cache automatically. Closes: #235067.
  * Update build-dependencies and -dev dependencies.
  * Standards version is 3.8.0.
  * Switch to quilt for patch management; build-depend on quilt.

    SETTINGS_PLUGINS since plugins are actually relying on them being 
    available.

  * 99_ltmain_as-needed.patch: new patch, make --as-needed work.

      daemon.
  * Add some comments in the patches.
  * Pass --no-act to dh_makeshlibs.
  * gnome-settings-daemon.postinst: remove /etc/gnome/config/xrdb.

    capplets-data which are still used.
  * Do not install the autostart file since we still use gnome-session 
    2.22 which will start g-s-d by hand.
